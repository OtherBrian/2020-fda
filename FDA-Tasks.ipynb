    "Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook."

    "----\n",
    "### Checking for Dictionary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "As the program must return a dictionary of the unique items in the list, alongside how frequently they appear as value, we must first ensure we know how to iterate over a dictionary's keys. This will allow us to check if a list item already exists as a key, and so our program can take the necessary next step; create a new key for the new item, or update the value for the existing key if it is a duplicate item.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by using a Dictionary Membership Test[6], which will return a boolean (True or False) depending on whether or not the variable already exists in the dictionary. The syntax for a dictionary membership test is simply:\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable in dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "or alternatively you can check if a key does not already exist in the dictionary by using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable not in dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "With this membership test, we can then use a straightforward If/Else statement to determine whether or not a new key must be created, or if an existing key needs its value altered[2][3]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if variable in dictionary:\n",
    "    dictionary[variable] += 1\n",
    "else:\n",

    "### Nested lists and how to deal with them\n",
    "\n",
    "While the example list included in the problem statement doesn't contain any nested lists, they are something that the program might encounter in the real world. Therefore it's important to find a solution for this now, and one that will ideally scale with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As lists are a hashable data type (i.e. they can altered), they cannot be used as a dictionary key, as outlined in the Python Data Structure documentation[4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().```\n",
    "\n",
    "This therefore opens up two potential solutions - change the nested list to a tuple, or find a way to iterate over the nest lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting a nested list into a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the inner list into a tuple, and using that as the key is a straightforward solution. The FOR loop would just need to check the type of the next item it's iterating through, and if it's a list, convert that item to a tuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if type(list[item]) == list:\n",
    "    item = tuple(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, this would encounter an issue if there's yet another list within this second layer of lists. The Python Data Structure[4] documentation explicitly says that if the \"tuple contains a mutable object\" (in this case a list) \"either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key\". Therefore the additional nested listed will prevent this solution from working in all situations. Alongside this, tuples as keys might not be the ideal real world solution anyway, as it opens up the possibility of lengthy dictionary keys that may not serve much purpose for analysis. \n",

    "\n",
    "Obviously in such a situation my code would be unnecessarily repetitive in most scenarios, and not repetitive enough in others. I had to find a way to reuse my original FOR loop for updating the dictionary keys, without having to repeat that code endlessly, and fortunately Python has just the tool I need - nested functions[5]. This will ensure that my code is DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself[7].\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining my initial FOR loop as a nested function, I will be able call it as many times as I need without having to repeat those 5 lines of code each time. Better yet, as this function is nested within the Counts function, it can make use of the same input parameters as were provided when the Counts function was called. Similarly, if I am using a nested function for the dictionary keys FOR loop, I could also use one for the FOR loop which checks if the next list item is of list type itself.\n"

To do this, I will need a pseudorandom number generator, and as has been shown in other assignments and lectures this semester, Numpy.Random would help me here. However, Numpy is not part of the Python Standard Library[1], and so I will have to utilise the Random module. Within the Random module, there is the \"randrange\" function, which will return an integer value. The syntax for this function is as follows[2]:\n",

    "\n",
    "When \"n\" is set to a high number (e.g. the 1000 given in the problem statement), it's expected that all of the possible outcomes will be rolled. This would mean that the dictionary keys include all possible variations and the amount of times it appeared. However, for smaller sample sizes (for example is n=5), there will be possible totals that do not appear. My interpretation of the problem is that in this scenario, the possible total should still exist as a dictionary key, but with the value set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, I will first need to get all of the possible totals from \"k\" dice. I was able to find a Stack Overflow question similar to this scenario, which pointed me towards the itertools module[3]. As this module is included in the Python Standard Library[1], I can still use it for this problem.\n",

    "I can then use an IF statement to check that that combination's total does not exist as a dictionary key. If the combination's total isn't already a dictionary key, the IF statement will create a new dictionary key for that total with 0 as it's value, otherwise it will skip over it. This is because there's multiple ways to make some of the possible totals (e.g. with 2 dice, there's 6 possible ways to make a total of 7), but I only need 1 of each total as a dictionary key."

    "The numpy.random.binomial function can be used to simulate flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails. Interestingly, if a coin is flipped many times then the number of heads is well approximated by a bell-shaped curve. For instance, if we flip a coin 100 times in a row the chance of getting 50 heads is relatively high, the chances of getting 0 or 100 heads is relatively low, and the chances of getting any other number of heads decreases as you move away from 50 in either direction towards 0 or 100. Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. You should explain your work in a Markdown cell above the code."

While normally one would expect to use a histogram, as I had set the frequenies as dictionary keys and turned the dictionary into a pandas dataframe, a histogram would not work. This meant that the \"results\" were on the index of the dataframe, and the \"frequency\" was one of variables, and so a histogram would simply show how frequent the \"frequency\" variable was in the dataframe.

    "This works well, and we can see the approximation of a bell curve here. However in order to really show that this is a bell curve, I can utilize Seaborn's histplot. The Seaborn histplot allows the user to include a Kernal Density Estimate (KDE)[3]. This KDE can be used to give an approximation of the shape of the data[4]. and so in this example it can really show whether or not our data has that bell curve shape we'd expect of a normal distribution."

    "Simpson’s paradox is a well-known statistical paradox where a trend evident in a number of groups reverses when the groups are combined into one big data set. Use numpy to create four data sets, each with an x array and a corresponding y array, to demonstrate Simpson’s paradox. You might create your x arrays using numpy.linspace and create the y array for each x using notation like y = a * x + b where you choose the a and b for each x , y pair to demonstrate the paradox. You might see the Wikipedia page for Simpson’s paradox for inspiration."

    "In my professional life, I see Simpson's Paradox fairly regularly when looking at the amount of support tickets my team gets through when compared to their tenure on the team. Newer people tend to focus on the easier tickets, and have fewer additional responsibilities, and so their ticket count can be very high. Meanwhile people that have been on the team for longer tend to take on more challenging or higher value tickets, and will often have additional responsibilities and projects that take them away from tickets, and so their ticket count is reduced. If I look at the team as a whole, I will see that as tenure increases ticket count decreases, regardless of any actual trends in team performance. It is for this reason that I must split my team into similar cohorts for analysis. This similar to how variables like age can impact overall health related datasets[5]\n",

    "For example, restaurant A may get better reviews from male reviewers and female reviewers then restaurant B, yet still end up with a lower overall score[1]. If men tend to give lower ratings to restaurants in general, and more men had reviewed restaurant A than B, this would bring down its overall rating, especially if the men substantially outnumbered the women."

    "For this I'll be creating four datasets that start and end at different points of the X axis. This will create a step effect, and so although each will have positive trends, the fact that the higher Y values appear earlier on the X axis will bring the overall trend down. I will use the Seaborn Regplot throughout, as this includes a linear regression in the plot[2]."
