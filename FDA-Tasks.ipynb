    "Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook."

    "### Checking for Dictionary keys\n",
    "\n",
    "As the program must return a dictionary of the unique items in the list, alongside how frequently they appear as value, we must first ensure we know how to iterate over a dictionary's keys. This will allow us to check if a list item already exists as a key, and so our program can take the necessary next step; create a new key for the new item, or update the value for the existing key if it is a duplicate item.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by using a Dictionary Membership Test[6], which will return a boolean (True or False) depending on whether or not the variable already exists in the dictionary. The syntax for a dictionary membership test is simply:\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable in dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "or alternatively you can check if a key does not already exist in the dictionary by using:\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable not in dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "With this membership test, we can then use a straightforward If/Else statement to determine whether or not a new key must be created, or if an existing key needs its value altered[2][3]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if variable in dictionary:\n",
    "    dictionary[variable] += 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    dictionary[variable] = 1\n",

    "### Nested lists and how to deal with them\n",
    "\n",
    "While the example list included in the problem statement doesn't contain any nested lists, they are something that the program might encounter in the real world. Therefore it's important to find a solution for this now, and one that will ideally scale with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "As lists are a hashable data type (i.e. they can altered), they cannot be used as a dictionary key, as outlined in the Python Data Structure documentation[4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().```\n",
    "\n",
    "This therefore opens up two potential solutions - change the nested list to a tuple, or find a way to iterate over the nest lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting a nested list into a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the inner list into a tuple, and using that as the key is a straightforward solution. The FOR loop would just need to check the type of the next item it's iterating through, and if it's a list, convert that item to a tuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if type(list[item]) == list:\n",
    "    item = tuple(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, this would encounter an issue if there's yet another list within this second layer of lists. The Python Data Structure[4] documentation explicitly says that if the \"tuple contains a mutable object\" (in this case a list) \"either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key\". Therefore the additional nested listed will prevent this solution from working in all situations. Alongside this, tuples as keys might not be the ideal real world solution anyway, as it opens up the possibility of lengthy dictionary keys that may not serve much purpose for analysis. \n",

    "The first step to solving this problem is working out how to simulate rolling a die, i.e. picking a random number from 1-6, with each number having an equal chance of being picked. To do this, I will need a pseudorandom number generator, and as has been shown in other assignments and lectures this semester, Numpy.Random would help me here. However, Numpy is not part of the Python Standard Library[1], and so I will have to utilise the Random module. Within the Random module, there is the \"randrange\" function, which will return an integer value. The syntax for this function is as follows[2]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "random.randrange(start, stop[, step])\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, I will set the \"start\" value to 1, the \"stop\" value to 7 (as it is not inclusive), and will not enter a \"step\" value. This gives me a function that will randomly pick a number from 1-6, and will act as my die for this problem."

For example, if \"k\" is set to 4, range(4) will create a range object with 4 elements, and thus the FOR loop will run 4 times.

    "### Ensuring all possible totals appear as keys\n",
    "\n",
    "When \"n\" is set to a high number (e.g. the 1000 given in the problem statement), it's expected that all of the possible outcomes will be rolled. This would mean that the dictionary keys include all possible variations and the amount of times it appeared. However, for smaller sample sizes (for example is n=5), there will be possible totals that do not appear. My interpretation of the problem is that in this scenario, the possible total should still exist as a dictionary key, but with the value set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, I will first need to get all of the possible totals from \"k\" dice. I was able to find a Stack Overflow question similar to this scenario, which pointed me towards the itertools module[3]. As this module is included in the Python Standard Library[1], I can still use it for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the itertools.product function, with range(1,7) and repeat=k as the parameters, I can generate every combination of \"k\" dice. I can then sum those combinations to give me every possible total:\n",
    "```\n",

    "        combination = sum(dice)            \n",
    "```\n",
    "I can then use an IF statement to check that that combination's total does not exist as a dictionary key. If the combination's total isn't already a dictionary key, the IF statement will create a new dictionary key for that total with 0 as it's value, otherwise it will skip over it. This is because there's multiple ways to make some of the possible totals (e.g. with 2 dice, there's 6 possible ways to make a total of 7), but I only need 1 of each total as a dictionary key."
