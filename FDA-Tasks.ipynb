    "Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook."

    "As the program must return a dictionary of the unique items in the list, alongside how frequently they appear as value, we must first ensure we know how to iterate over a dictionary's keys.

    "While the example list included in the problem statement doesn't contain any nested lists, they are something that the program might encounter in the real world. Therefore it's important to find a solution for this now, and one that will ideally scale with the program.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().```\n",

    "### Converting a nested into a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the inner list into a tuple, and using that as the key is straightforward solution. The FOR loop would just need to check the type of the next item it's iterating through, and if it's a list, convert that item to a tuple:\n",

The Python Data Structure[4] documentation explicitly says that if the \"tuple contains a mutable object\" (in this case a list) \"either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key\". Therefore the additional nested listed will prevent this solution from working on in all situations. Alongside this, tuples as keys might not be the ideal real world solution anyway, as it opens up the possibility of lengthy dictionary keys that may not serve much purpose for analysis. \n",
